# Data & Derivatives

In this step we will extend our server so that we can list models, upload them,
and prepare them for viewing.

## Data management

First, let's make sure that our application has a bucket in the Data Management service
to store its files in. Typically the bucket would be created just once as part of a provisioning
step but in our sample we will implement a helper function that will make sure that the bucket
is available, and use it in other parts of the server app.

## Derivatives

Next, we will implement a couple of helper functions that will derive/extract various types of information
from the uploaded files - for example, 2D drawings, 3D geometry, and metadata - that we can later load
into Forge Viewer in our webpage. To do so, we will need to start a new conversion job
in the [Model Derivative](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview)
service, and checking the status of the conversion.

Model Derivative service requires all IDs we use in the API calls to be [base64](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)-encoded,
so we include a small utility function that will help with that.

:::info
Base64-encoded IDs are referred to as _URNs_.

## Server endpoints

Now let's make the new functionality available to the client through another
set of endpoints.

<EnvTabs NodeJsVsCode={NodeJsVsCodeEndpoints} DotNetVsCode={DotNetEndpoints} DotNetVs2022={DotNetEndpoints} />

## Try it out

Start (or restart) the app as usual, and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/models](http://localhost:8080/api/models)
in the browser. The server should respond with a JSON list with names and URNs of all objects
available in your configured bucket.

:::info
If this is your first time working with Forge, you may get a JSON response
with an empty array (`[]`) which is expected. In the screenshot below we can
already see a couple of files that were uploaded to our bucket in the past.

:::tip
If you are using Google Chrome, consider installing [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
or a similar extension to automatically format JSON responses.
